# Vexel

Vexel is a high-performance, JIT-compiled scripting language designed for efficiency and ease of use. It features a simple and intuitive syntax while leveraging just-in-time (JIT) compilation for optimal execution speed. üöÄ

## Features

- **JIT Compilation**: Execute code with high efficiency using just-in-time compilation.
- **Simple Syntax**: Clean and easy-to-read syntax for quick development.
- **Dynamic Typing**: No need to explicitly declare variable types.

## Example Code

```bash
set x 5
set greeting "hello" 
set is_active true

print greeting

function squirrelsay(message) start
    print string_concat("üêøÔ∏è - ", message)
end

set array ["H", "i"]
set array array_push(array, "!")

if is_active != false start
    set string_array array_to_string(array)
    squirrelsay(string_array)
end

```
